# Sail System

## Overview
**Sail System** is a decentralized AI deployment framework that builds on the power and flexibility of Sails.js. Designed for developers seeking to create scalable, real-time, and open-source AI applications, Sail System bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and decentralized innovation. By combining pre-built tools, robust WebSocket capabilities, and a tokenized ecosystem, it simplifies the process of deploying and managing AI-powered systems.

## Key Features
- **Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)**: Sail System uses a model-driven approach for rapid API development, enabling developers to auto-generate RESTful and real-time WebSocket APIs based on their data models.
- **Blueprint APIs**: Automatically create CRUD endpoints for your models, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Real-Time Support**: Integrated WebSocket support ensures seamless real-time functionality for applications like chat systems and live analytics.
- **Database-Agnostic ORM**: Powered by Waterline, Sail System supports popular databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more.
- **Tokenized Ecosystem ($SAIL)**: Incentivize contributors, reward participation, and unlock advanced features using the $SAIL token.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Build applications that range from prototypes to enterprise-grade solutions with ease.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Encourage innovation through an open, decentralized community.

## Why Sail System?
1. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies AI deployments with intuitive commands and pre-built blueprints.
2. **Flexibility**: Integrates seamlessly with front-end frameworks and supports diverse databases.
3. **Real-Time Applications**: Optimized for live interactions, making it ideal for chat systems, analytics dashboards, and collaborative tools.
4. **Community-Driven**: Open-source and tokenized to ensure continuous growth and innovation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher
- **npm**: Version 6.x or higher

### Installing Sail System
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sail-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sail-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Initializing a New Project
1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   sails new my-ai-project
   ```
2. Choose a template (e.g., `API` or `Web App`) when prompted.
3. Navigate to your project directory and lift the server:
   ```bash
   sails lift
   ```
4. Your application will be available at `http://localhost:1337`.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Model
Define a model for your data:
```javascript
// api/models/User.js
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    username: { type: 'string', required: true, unique: true },
    email: { type: 'string', isEmail: true, required: true },
    password: { type: 'string', required: true },
  },
};
```

### Generating APIs
Blueprint routes automatically create APIs for CRUD operations:
- **Create**: `POST /user`
- **Read**: `GET /user/:id`
- **Update**: `PUT /user/:id`
- **Delete**: `DELETE /user/:id`

### Real-Time Updates
Enable WebSocket support for live interactions:
```javascript
sails.sockets.broadcast('roomName', 'message', { data: 'real-time update' });
```

## Tokenized Ecosystem
Sail System integrates $SAIL tokens to power its decentralized economy. Use $SAIL tokens for:
- **Governance**: Vote on platform updates and improvements.
- **Rewards**: Incentivize contributions and model sharing.
- **Access**: Unlock advanced deployment features and tools.

### Example Token Integration
```javascript
const tokenBalance = async (userId) => {
  const balance = await sails.helpers.token.getBalance(userId);
  return balance;
};
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to Sail System! Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

1. Fork the repository:
   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/yourusername/sail-system.git
   ```
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```
4. Push to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
5. Open a pull request on GitHub.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Policies
Add authorization and logic for specific routes:
```javascript
// api/policies/isAuthenticated.js
module.exports = async function (req, res, proceed) {
  if (req.session.user) {
    return proceed();
  }
  return res.forbidden();
};
```

### Hooks
Extend or customize functionality:
```javascript
// api/hooks/myCustomHook/index.js
module.exports = function myCustomHook(sails) {
  return {
    initialize: async function () {
      sails.log('My custom hook initialized!');
    },
  };
};
```

### Services
Encapsulate reusable business logic:
```javascript
// api/services/UserService.js
module.exports = {
  hashPassword: async (password) => {
    const hashed = await require('bcrypt').hash(password, 10);
    return hashed;
  },
};
```
