# Contributing to Sail-System

This guide is designed to help you get off the ground quickly contributing to Sail-System.  Reading it thoroughly will help you write useful issues, make eloquent proposals, and submit top-notch code that can be merged quickly.  Respecting the guidelines laid out here helps make the core maintainers of Sail-System more productive, and makes the experience of working with Sail-System positive and enjoyable for the community at large.

If you are working on a pull request, **please carefully read the this guide in its entirety**. In case of doubt, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/balderdashy/Sail-System/issues/new) or contact someone from our [core team](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/about) on Twitter. Especially do so if you plan to work on something big. Nothing is more frustrating than seeing your hard work go to waste because your vision does not align with planned or ongoing development efforts of the project's maintainers.
