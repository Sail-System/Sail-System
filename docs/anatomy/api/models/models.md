# api/models/

This is the directory that holds your models.  In Sail-System, models are the structures that contain data for your Sail-System App.

You can learn more about how to define and use models in [Concepts > Models and ORM > Models](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models), and about how to generate them [here](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/reference/command-line-interface/Sail-System-generate#?core-generators).
