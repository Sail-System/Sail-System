# api/

This folder contains the vast majority of your app's back-end logic.  It is home to the 'M' and 'C' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC Framework</a>.

In it you will find the following:

- Controllers: [Actions](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) contain back-end logic that handle incoming requests (like handling a form submission or responding with personalized, server-rendered HTML).
- Helpers: [Helpers](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) are shared functions that can be called from anywhere in your app.
- Models: [Models](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm) are the structures that contain data for your Sail-System App.
- Policies: [Policies](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/policies) are middleware that restrict access to certain actions in your app.

You may also find these folders, which are not always generated by default in new Sail-System apps:

- Hooks: [Hooks](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-Sail-System/hooks) are modules that add functionality to Sail-System core.  You can use hooks to run custom code when your app lifts and before handling every incoming request.  Hooks can also be installed as plugins, but the hooks in this folder are always custom for your application.
- Responses: [Custom responses](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-Sail-System/custom-responses) can help maintain consistent HTTP status codes and behavior across your app.  (Since not every Sail-System application needs to define its own custom responses, this folder is sometimes excluded.)
- Services: [Services](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/services) are shared utilities common in Sail-System apps written before version 1.0.  They can be _just about anything_, so for new apps, it's recommended that you use [helpers](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) instead.
