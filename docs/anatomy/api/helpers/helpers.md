# api/helpers/

This is the directory that holds your helpers.  In Sail-System, helpers are shared functions that can be called from anywhere in your app.

When you call `Sail-System generate helper tickle-user` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Sail-System will generate the file `api/helpers/tickle-user.js`, with a skeleton helper file to get you started.

See the [main helpers documentation](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) for more info.
