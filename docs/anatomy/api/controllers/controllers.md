# api/controllers/

This is the directory that holds your controllers.  In Sail-System, controllers are JavaScript files that contain logic for interacting with models and rendering appropriate views to the client.

When you call `Sail-System generate api cats` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Sail-System will generate the file `api/controllers/CatsController.js` along with a matching model.

The `api/controllers` directory can also contain _standalone actions_, which are JavaScript files containing a _single_ controller action, rather than a dictionary of actions.

See the [main actions and controllers documentation](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) for more info.
