# config/log.js

This file contains the logger configuration for your Sail-System app.

Configure the log level for your app, as well as the transport.

Underneath the covers, Sail-System uses Winston for logging, which allows for some pretty neat custom transports/adapters for log messages.

### Usage

See [`Sail-System.config.log`](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/Sail-System-config-log) for all available options.
