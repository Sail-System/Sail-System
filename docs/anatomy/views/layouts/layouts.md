# views/layouts/

This directory initially contains the default layout for your app, `layout.ejs`, but you can add any other layout files that you want to include in your app.

For more information on how to configure layouts, see [Concepts > Views > Layouts](https://Sail-Systemjs.com/documentation/concepts/views/layouts).
