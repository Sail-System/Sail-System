# Understanding Core

Welcome to the Sail-System.js Core.

The goal of this file is to provide a light overview of the structure and philosophy of Sail-System.js for core contributors, as well as establish code and documentation conventions.

Many of the subdirectories herein contain a `README.md` file with more information about that particular component.


## Overview

The Sail-System.js core runs when an app is fired up with `Sail-System.load` or `Sail-System.lift`.


## Stability Index

See the [Sail-System Project Stability Index](https://github.com/balderdashy/Sail-System/blob/master/docs/contributing/stability-index.md) for more information.  We use a slight variation of the [stability index] used by [Node.js core](http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index); partially out of allegiance, but mostly for consistency.
